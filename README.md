**Data Science Internship Tasks - Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization**

**Project Overview**
This repository contains four tasks focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualization using Python. Each task involves loading a dataset, cleaning it, performing visualizations, and summarizing key insights.

**Tasks Overview**
**Task 1: EDA and Visualization of a Real-World Dataset**  
- **Dataset Used**: Titanic Dataset  
- **Steps**:  
  - Load the dataset using `pandas`.  
  - Clean data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and managing outliers.  
  - Visualize key trends using **bar charts, histograms, and a correlation heatmap**.  
  - Summarize findings and key insights.

**Task 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**  
- **Goal**: Prepare data for machine learning models.  
- **Steps**:  
  - Handle categorical and numerical data using encoding techniques.  
  - Scale numerical features using **StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler**.  
  - Create new features based on domain knowledge.  
  - Split the dataset into **training and testing sets**.

**Task 3: Model Training and Evaluation**  
- **Goal**: Train a machine learning model and evaluate performance.  
- **Steps**:  
  - Choose an appropriate classification model (e.g., **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest**).  
  - Train the model on preprocessed data.  
  - Evaluate model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
  - Optimize the model using **hyperparameter tuning**.

**Task 4: Deployment and API Integration**  
- **Goal**: Deploy the trained model using a web framework (e.g., **Flask or FastAPI**).  
- **Steps**:  
  - Develop a simple API for model predictions.  
  - Implement endpoints to receive input data and return predictions.  
  - Test the API using **Postman or cURL**.  
  - Deploy the API on **Heroku, AWS, or Azure**.

**Observations**
- **EDA revealed significant insights**, such as survival rate variations based on class, gender, and fare.  
- **Feature engineering improved model performance** by encoding categorical variables.  
- **Model evaluation helped identify the best-performing algorithm**.  
- **The trained model was successfully deployed as an API**, making it accessible for real-time predictions.
